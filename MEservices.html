                        <p>
                            Product designers not only make your product presentable but they also help you identify, examine and validate the problem that your product addresses to subsequently reach a solution. Designing a new idea is not merely about its physical form; it involves problem solving to improve the quality of a new or existing product and enhance the user experience.
                            This process consists of designing new or breathing life into existing ideas. Depending on your design requirements, the process can be different. We outline the our many possible steps an invention may require before it can become a marketable product starting with Research, Concept Development, Ergonomics, Aesthetics to Mechanical design.

                        <h3>Robotics & Automation</h3>
                        <p>


                            Worldwide, businesses are rapidly growing owing to the innovation and technology exploration. As the businesses are moving towards advancement, they are looking for solutions which can automate their business operations to improve the efficiency by saving additional cost and time.
                            Robotic process automation (RPA) solutions can help business to achieve operation automation goals. RPA developed on the idea of artificial intelligence makes use of robot software to perform tasks and operations, which usually do not require any decision-making. RPA automates the repetitive tasks required for clerical and back office operations, where the tasks are executed by virtual workforce (robots) instead of humans.
                            Here are few factors which might help you in considering RPA for your business operations-
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <i class="icofont-check-circled"></i>For successful execution of RPA, no coding skills are required. All the operations driven by RPA can be performed by providing training on the tools within a short span of time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i class="icofont-check-circled"></i>Incorporating RPA tools for your business can be less complex and are risk-free. This is because the tools are very light and the robots access the computers in the same way humans do without interrupting the actual code.
                                </li>
                                <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i>RPA tools provide ease of use and are user-friendly. They are low maintenance and hence, can be effectively used for the business operations.  </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
